# EmergencyPipou

A simple Twitter bot made in PHP that tweets cute things to its followers

It is a copy of [@petosorus](https://github.com/petosorus)'s Twitter bot project [EmergencyPipou](https://github.com/petosorus/emergencyPipou) but in PHP instead of Python.
[@EmergencyPipou](https://twitter.com/EmergencyPipou) chooses a random follower and tweets to him/her a random cute sentence from the ones stored in <code>Phrases.php</code>.

If you mention it, it replies with a random cute sentence as well.

## Contribute
